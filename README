OPAM bundler
============

opam-bundle takes an OPAM package name (target) and creates an archive with the
sources of the package and all its transitive dependencies along with the shell script
to build the target in the standalone setting.

After that the bundle can be distributed to other hosts (without OPAM or any
OCaml libraries installed) and used to build the target software without
requestiing the user to install OPAM and dependecies manually. Dependencies get
built and installed into the local directory independently from the host
environment by configuring the environment variables for OCaml tools
appropriately.

opam-bundle will use the information from the current OPAM switch when creating
the bundle (.e.g. the list of installed packages, optional dependencies, compiler
version) which may (will) influence the dependency resolution and the contents of the
bundle.
